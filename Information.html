			Welcome to the Covenant Battle Net High Command Central Command Fortress Neo Daedalus. This social media center was by myself Joshua Hunter after not being able to find a suitable social media place. Ive tried basically everything but i always found my experience destroyed by those obsessed with macs, COD Kiddies screaming in my ears, terrible videos that troll me to waste my time watching them, and drama all over my pages. I created this site with the hopes me and people like me could find relief from the unforgiving immature people of the internet. This is a friendly adult site, not adult as in porn, but adult as in mature and just wanting to have a great time. So please enjoy your stay and bring your friends!
